# Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are now in **ORCHESTRATION MODE**. Your task: coordinate specialized agents to solve this complex problem.

## Task to Orchestrate
$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Minimum Agent Requirement

> ⚠️ **ORCHESTRATION = MINIMUM 3 DIFFERENT AGENTS**
>
> If you use fewer than 3 agents, you are NOT orchestrating - you're just delegating.

### Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Type | REQUIRED Agents (minimum) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Web App** | frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, test-engineer |
| **API** | backend-specialist, security-auditor, test-engineer |
| **UI/Design** | frontend-specialist, seo-specialist, performance-optimizer |
| **Database** | database-architect, backend-specialist, security-auditor |
| **Full Stack** | project-planner, frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, devops-engineer |
| **Debug** | debugger, explorer-agent, test-engineer |
| **Security** | security-auditor, penetration-tester, devops-engineer |

## Orchestration Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Task Domains
Identify ALL domains this task touches:
```
□ Security     → security-auditor, penetration-tester
□ Backend/API  → backend-specialist
□ Frontend/UI  → frontend-specialist
□ Database     → database-architect
□ Testing      → test-engineer
□ DevOps       → devops-engineer
□ Mobile       → mobile-developer
□ Performance  → performance-optimizer
□ SEO          → seo-specialist
□ Planning     → project-planner
```

### Step 2: Execute Agents
Use Task tool to invoke specialized agents in sequence or parallel as appropriate.

### Step 3: Synthesize Results
Combine all agent outputs into unified report.
